Create Advance Scouting Reports on Pitchers using TrackMan Data

This R script takes a TrackMan CSV and turns it into a XLSX file to be used for advance scouting pitchers. It is inspired by the advance scouting reports created by the Seattle Mariners, who I interned with during the 2023 MLB season, and was built for use by UCLA Baseball.

This particular script creates a report for Kelly Austin, a former right-handed pitcher with UCLA, signed by the Houston Astros in 2023 and traded to the New York Yankees in 2024. I also included the original XLSX file created by this script, the XLSX file after I wrote in thoughts about facing Austin, and the final version in a PDF format.
